Crust programming language

I don't have any experience with x86 assembly, everything I know about it is from writing this compiler, so the generated code is probably not the best.

# Runtime dependencies
*  as
*  ld
*  cp

# Building
```
git clone https://github.com/longwatermelon/crust
cd crust
make
```

# Todo
*  Inline asm
*  Rewrite builtin function pront to print variable length strings
*  Implement returning structs from functions and passing structs to functions
*  Loops, if statements, etc.
*  List data type
