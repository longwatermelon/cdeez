Crust programming language

I don't have any experience with x86 assembly, everything I know about it is from writing this compiler, so the generated code is probably not the best.

# Runtime dependencies
* as
* ld
* cp

# Building
```
git clone https://github.com/longwatermelon/crust
cd crust
make
```

# Todo
* Inline asm
* Rewrite builtin function pront to print variable length strings
* Implement returning structs from functions and passing structs to functions
* Loops, if statements, etc.
* List data type
