# hamcc
Logically it should be called hamc not hamcc because it's "ham compiler", but I don't feel like renaming so I'll pretend it stands for ham c compiler.

I don't have any experience with x86 assembly, everything I know about it is from writing this compiler, so the generated code is probably not the best.
